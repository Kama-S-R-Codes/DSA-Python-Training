## My DSA Python Journey 🐍✨

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) with Python repository.

This repository is not just for solving problems — it’s structured as a **teaching resource** for students and learners preparing for coding interviews and placements.

Each topic includes:
- 📂 Python programs
- 📝 Explanations of brute force and optimized approaches or iterative and Recursive approache
- 🎯 Time and Space Complexity analysis
- 💡 Teaching notes (how I explain to students)
- 🔗 Code files with comments written for beginners
  
## Structure
- Arrays → Basics, Two Sum, Kadane’s Algorithm, Sliding Window
- Strings → Palindrome, Anagrams, Substrings
- DP → Fibonacci, Knapsack, Coin Change
- Graphs → BFS, DFS, Shortest Path

## Teaching Approach
When I teach DSA, I follow this flow:

1. Start with the problem statement.
2. Walk through the brute force solution.
3. Analyze time/space complexity.
4. Introduce the optimized approach.
5. Explain with examples & dry runs.
6. Provide the Python code with comments.

## Goal
- This repo is designed to showcase problem-solving + teaching skills.
- By combining clear code, structured explanations, and complexity analysis, I aim to help students learn DSA step by step with Python.
  
##  Follow this repo to learn DSA the way I teach it in my classes!
