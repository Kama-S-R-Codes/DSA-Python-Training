# Problem: Two Sum 
# Problem: Given an array of numbers, return indices of the two numbers that add up to a target.
# Approach 2: HashMap (Dictionary in Python):
#   - For each number, we calculate its "complement" = target - number.
#   - If this complement has already been seen, we found the answer.
#   - Otherwise, store the number with its index in a dictionary for future checks.
# Time Complexity: O(n^2)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
# Teaching Note: Starting point before introducing optimized approach of HashMap
# Time Complexity: O(n)   (one pass through array, O(1) lookups)
# Space Complexity: O(n)  (store seen numbers in dictionary)
